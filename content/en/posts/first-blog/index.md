# Introducing Myself – Mankirat Singh | GSoC 2025 Contributor @ PostgreSQL 🚀

Hey there! I’m **Mankirat Singh**, a Computer Engineering undergrad at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (Batch of 2026), passionate about building things that matter — from scalable full-stack apps to lunar navigation systems. And this year, I’m thrilled to share that I’m a **Google Summer of Code 2025 Contributor with PostgreSQL**!

## 🔧 What to Expect from This Blog Series

In this blog series, I’ll be documenting my entire GSoC journey:

- 🧠 My project, goals, and weekly progress  
- 🛠️ Technical challenges and solutions  
- 🔍 Learnings from working with world-class open-source mentors  
- 📈 Tips for future contributors  

## 👨‍💻 A Bit About Me

Over the past couple of years, I’ve worn many hats — full stack intern, Flutter developer, research intern — and have worked on projects ranging from timetable optimization algorithms to space-tech solutions.

Some highlights:
- 🛰️ **LUNAR**: 3D rover navigation system built using React, YOLOv5, and Three.js — *Winner at Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon by ISRO, honored by the President of India*  
- 📱 **Feedback App**: Cross-platform feedback collection app used by 10,000+ users at TIET  
- 📦 **RRCC Software**: Live resource tracking system for the Indian Army's EME unit  
- 🤖 **PDF QnA Bot**: Built with Llama3 + Faiss for efficient PDF querying

I’m currently the **Technical Head** of the Microsoft Learn Student Chapter at TIET and an active open-source contributor with a strong love for backend systems, databases, and AI.
